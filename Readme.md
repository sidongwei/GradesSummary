The program is written in Python 3.6.9, the only package used in the program is Numpy 1.15.4
To run the program, simply run the "main.py" file with command "python3 main.py", then several plain-text report files will be generated; the names of the files generated are "report_card_student_x", where "x" is the student id respectively.

This project will load 4 ".csv" data files from the current directory which store the information of students, courses, tests and marks respectively, and then output one report file for each individual student.
The users could add, edit, or remove entries from the data files as long as the modifications are consistent with each other and the names and structures of the data files are not changed.
If the program is not running properly, please check each data file and try to eliminate all the inconsistent information (i.e. marks not complete, inconsistent ids, etc.).
